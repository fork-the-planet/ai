Add `@cloudflare/tanstack-ai` — adapters for using TanStack AI with Cloudflare Workers AI and AI Gateway.

### Workers AI adapters

All Workers AI adapters support four configuration modes: plain binding (`env.AI`), plain REST (account ID + API key), AI Gateway binding (`env.AI.gateway(id)`), and AI Gateway REST (account ID + gateway ID).

- **Chat** (`createWorkersAiChat`) — Streaming chat completions via the OpenAI-compatible API. Includes tool calling with full round-trip support, structured output via `json_schema`, and reasoning text streaming (`STEP_STARTED`/`STEP_FINISHED` AG-UI events) for models like QwQ, DeepSeek R1, and Kimi K2.5. A custom fetch shim translates OpenAI SDK calls to `env.AI.run()` for binding mode, with a stream transformer that handles both Workers AI native format and OpenAI-compatible format.
- **Image generation** (`createWorkersAiImage`) — Stable Diffusion and other text-to-image models.
- **Transcription** (`createWorkersAiTranscription`) — Speech-to-text via Whisper and Deepgram Nova-3.
- **Text-to-speech** (`createWorkersAiTts`) — Audio generation via Deepgram Aura-1.
- **Summarization** (`createWorkersAiSummarize`) — Text summarization via BART-large-CNN.
- **Embeddings** (`createWorkersAiEmbedding`) — Text embeddings (implemented but not yet exported, pending TanStack AI's `BaseEmbeddingAdapter`).

### AI Gateway adapters (third-party providers)

Route requests through Cloudflare AI Gateway for caching, rate limiting, and unified billing. Each adapter injects a custom `fetch` (or `httpOptions` for Gemini) that handles both binding and credential-based gateway configurations.

- **OpenAI** — Chat, summarize, image, transcription, TTS, video (`createOpenAi*`)
- **Anthropic** — Chat, summarize (`createAnthropic*`)
- **Gemini** — Chat, summarize, image, TTS (`createGemini*`). Credentials-only (Google GenAI SDK lacks custom fetch support).
- **Grok** — Chat, summarize, image (`createGrok*`)
- **OpenRouter** — Chat, summarize, image (`createOpenRouter*`). Accepts any model string.

### Utilities

- `createGatewayFetch` — Shared fetch factory that routes requests through AI Gateway (binding or REST), with support for cache control headers (`skipCache`, `cacheTtl`, `customCacheKey`, `metadata`).
- `createWorkersAiBindingFetch` — Fetch shim that makes `env.AI` look like an OpenAI endpoint, including stream transformation and tool call ID sanitization for the binding's strict `[a-zA-Z0-9]{9}` validation.
- Config detection helpers (`isDirectBindingConfig`, `isDirectCredentialsConfig`, `isGatewayConfig`) using structural typing to discriminate `env.AI` from `env.AI.gateway(id)`.
- Shared binary utilities for normalizing Workers AI responses (Uint8Array, ArrayBuffer, ReadableStream, JSON wrapper) to base64.

### Robustness

- Premature stream termination detection — if Workers AI truncates a response or the connection drops (no `finish_reason`), the adapter emits proper closing events so consumers don't hang.
- Graceful non-streaming fallback — if a model returns a complete response despite `stream: true`, the binding shim wraps it into a valid response.
- Deepgram Nova-3 transcription uses raw binary audio via REST (not JSON), automatically detected by model name.

### Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests (186 tests) covering all adapters, config modes, stream transformation, message building, tool calling, reasoning events, premature termination, and public API surface.
- E2E integration tests against real Workers AI APIs (both binding and REST paths) across 12 chat models + 4 transcription models + image/TTS/summarize, validating chat, multi-turn, tool calling, tool round-trips, structured output, reasoning, and all non-chat capabilities.
- Tree-shakeable package exports with per-adapter entry points for ESM and CJS.
