# workers-ai-provider

## 3.1.13

### Patch Changes

- [#510](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/510) [`dfd2cb4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/dfd2cb4e6e10e2ec3dc149bbc344b34a63734d07) Thanks [@Specy](https://github.com/Specy)! - Map `inputTokens.cacheRead` and `inputTokens.noCache` from Workers AI's `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` instead of always reporting them as `undefined`. This makes prompt-cache hits visible to consumers that compute pricing or telemetry from `LanguageModelV3Usage` (`generateText`/`streamText` `result.usage`).

    `cached_tokens` is treated as `cacheRead`; `cacheWrite` remains `undefined` because the OpenAI-style usage shape Workers AI returns does not distinguish cache reads from writes.

    Closes [#509](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/issues/509).

## 3.1.12

### Patch Changes

- [#504](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/504) [`e9b2a9a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/e9b2a9a4e4e63a8c045c1ac9e5d07fec3d4f2535) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Forward `reasoning_effort` and `chat_template_kwargs` onto `binding.run(model, inputs)`'s `inputs` object instead of silently dropping them into the options arg / REST query string. This fixes reasoning models (GLM-4.7-flash, Kimi K2.5/K2.6, GPT-OSS, QwQ) burning the entire output token budget on chain-of-thought with no visible content.

    Both settings-level and per-call usage are supported:

    ```ts
    // Settings-level
    const model = workersai("@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash", {
    	reasoning_effort: "low",
    	chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking: false },
    });

    // Per-call (overrides settings)
    await generateText({
    	model,
    	prompt,
    	providerOptions: {
    		"workers-ai": { reasoning_effort: "low" },
    	},
    });
    ```

    `reasoning_effort: null` is preserved as-is (explicit "disable reasoning" signal). The two fields are also typed directly on `WorkersAIChatSettings`.

    Closes [#501](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/issues/501).

## 3.1.11

### Patch Changes

- [#494](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/494) [`ed6112a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/ed6112a7938ea3b9136876edb6830f3f1138d2b4) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Emit `tool-input-end` and `tool-call` events eagerly when streaming multiple tool calls, instead of deferring all of them to stream close. Previously, all tool calls appeared "in progress" simultaneously because `tool-input-end` was only emitted in `flush()`. Now each tool call is closed as soon as the next one starts or a null finalization chunk is received, matching the behavior of other AI SDK providers.

## 3.1.10

### Patch Changes

- [#480](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/480) [`1c6bdad`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/1c6bdade0f8ac07855876ddad96ab838435117bb) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add optional `fetch` parameter to credentials mode for request interception and testing. Available when using `accountId + apiKey` (not with bindings). Matches the pattern used by `@ai-sdk/openai` and `@ai-sdk/anthropic`.

## 3.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#457](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/457) [`cc94a06`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/cc94a06ca85603e473f41cc12ed83f53cbe9e136) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix request cancellation by propagating `abortSignal` to outbound network calls.

    **ai-gateway-provider**: Pass `abortSignal` to the `fetch` call (API path) and to `binding.run()` (binding path) so that cancelled requests are properly aborted.

    **workers-ai-provider**: Pass `abortSignal` to `binding.run()` for chat, embedding, and image models, matching the existing behavior in transcription, speech, and reranking models.

    **@cloudflare/tanstack-ai**: Pass `signal` through to `binding.run()` in both `createGatewayFetch` (AI Gateway binding path) and `createWorkersAiBindingFetch` (Workers AI binding path).

## 3.1.6

### Patch Changes

- [#454](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/454) [`29087ad`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/29087ad9ea9cb5398d03e0dfff13c24aa3759c61) Thanks [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)! - Fix three tool calling bugs that caused multi-turn agentic loops to fail

    **1. Tool result output not unwrapped**

    `convert-to-workersai-chat-messages.ts` was calling `JSON.stringify(toolResponse.output)` on the entire `LanguageModelV3ToolResultOutput` wrapper object (`{ type: 'text', value: '...' }`), sending the wrapper as the tool message content instead of just the value. Models received garbled tool results and stopped after the first tool call instead of continuing.

    Fix: extract `output.value` and serialize only that.

    **2. `toolChoice: "required"` mapped to `"any"` instead of `"required"`**

    `utils.ts` mapped `toolChoice: "required"` to `tool_choice: "any"`. All vLLM-backed models (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`, `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`, `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash`) return `8001: Invalid input` for `tool_choice: "any"`. The same incorrect mapping applied to `toolChoice: { type: "tool" }`.

    Fix: map both to `"required"`.

    **3. `description: false` in tool definitions**

    `utils.ts` used `&&` short-circuit for tool description and parameters, which evaluates to `false` (not `undefined`) when `tool.type !== "function"`. Sending `description: false` to the binding causes `8001: Invalid input`.

    Fix: use ternary to produce `undefined` when not applicable.

    Tested against `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`, `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`, and `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash` via the Workers AI binding.

## 3.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [#451](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/451) [`2a62e23`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/2a62e23c7159df5ba69348f15da7a44eef73e83d) Thanks [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)! - Fix reasoning content being concatenated into assistant message content in multi-turn conversations

    Previously, reasoning parts in assistant messages were concatenated into the `content` string when building message history. This caused models like `kimi-k2.5` and `deepseek-r1` to receive their own internal reasoning as if it were spoken text, corrupting the conversation history and resulting in empty text responses or leaked special tokens on subsequent turns.

    Reasoning parts are now sent as the `reasoning` field on the assistant message object, which is the field name vLLM expects on input for reasoning models (kimi-k2.5, glm-4.7-flash).

## 3.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#448](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/448) [`054ccb8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/054ccb834ea3eb7a07d2b011e1ff1b8344f348fb) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Fix image inputs for vision-capable chat models
    - Handle all `LanguageModelV3DataContent` variants (Uint8Array, base64 string, data URL) instead of only Uint8Array
    - Send images as OpenAI-compatible `image_url` content parts inline in messages, enabling vision for models like Llama 4 Scout and Kimi K2.5
    - Works with both the binding and REST API paths

## 3.1.3

Also forward `extraHeaders` in the REST API path instead of discarding them.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#389](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/389) [`8538cd5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/8538cd53ce2e1be28cca95217725dfd4642fd7da) Thanks [@vaibhavshn](https://github.com/vaibhavshn)! - Add transcription, text-to-speech, and reranking support to the Workers AI provider.

    ### New capabilities
    - **Transcription** (`provider.transcription(model)`) — implements `TranscriptionModelV3`. Supports Whisper models (`@cf/openai/whisper`, `whisper-tiny-en`, `whisper-large-v3-turbo`) and Deepgram Nova-3 (`@cf/deepgram/nova-3`). Handles model-specific input formats: number arrays for basic Whisper, base64 for v3-turbo via REST, and `{ body, contentType }` for Nova-3 via binding or raw binary upload for Nova-3 via REST.

    - **Speech / TTS** (`provider.speech(model)`) — implements `SpeechModelV3`. Supports Workers AI TTS models including Deepgram Aura-1 (`@cf/deepgram/aura-1`). Accepts `text`, `voice`, and `speed` options. Returns audio as `Uint8Array`. Uses `returnRawResponse` to handle binary audio from the REST path without JSON parsing.

    - **Reranking** (`provider.reranking(model)`) — implements `RerankingModelV3`. Supports BGE reranker models (`@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base`, `bge-reranker-v2-m3`). Converts AI SDK's document format to Workers AI's `{ query, contexts, top_k }` input. Handles both text and JSON object documents.

    ### Bug fixes
    - **AbortSignal passthrough** — `createRun` REST shim now passes the abort signal to `fetch`, enabling request cancellation and timeout handling. Previously the signal was silently dropped.
    - **Nova-3 REST support** — Added `createRunBinary` utility for models that require raw binary upload instead of JSON (used by Nova-3 transcription via REST).

    ### Usage

    ```typescript
    import { createWorkersAI } from "workers-ai-provider";
    import { experimental_transcribe, experimental_generateSpeech, rerank } from "ai";

    const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });

    // Transcription
    const transcript = await experimental_transcribe({
    	model: workersai.transcription("@cf/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo"),
    	audio: audioData,
    	mediaType: "audio/wav",
    });

    // Speech
    const speech = await experimental_generateSpeech({
    	model: workersai.speech("@cf/deepgram/aura-1"),
    	text: "Hello world",
    	voice: "asteria",
    });

    // Reranking
    const ranked = await rerank({
    	model: workersai.reranking("@cf/baai/bge-reranker-base"),
    	query: "What is machine learning?",
    	documents: ["ML is a branch of AI.", "The weather is sunny."],
    });
    ```

## 3.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [#393](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/393) [`91b32e0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/91b32e0b0ef543fd198ddf387b9521ac3bd9650a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Comprehensive cleanup of the workers-ai-provider package.

    **Bug fixes:**
    - Fixed phantom dependency on `fetch-event-stream` that caused runtime crashes when installed outside the monorepo. Replaced with a built-in SSE parser.
    - Fixed streaming buffering: responses now stream token-by-token instead of arriving all at once. The root cause was twofold — an eager `ReadableStream` `start()` pattern that buffered all chunks, and a heuristic that silently fell back to non-streaming `doGenerate` whenever tools were defined. Both are fixed. Streaming now uses a proper `TransformStream` pipeline with backpressure.
    - Fixed `reasoning-delta` ID mismatch in simulated streaming — was using `generateId()` instead of the `reasoningId` from the preceding `reasoning-start` event, causing the AI SDK to drop reasoning content.
    - Fixed REST API client (`createRun`) silently swallowing HTTP errors. Non-200 responses now throw with status code and response body.
    - Fixed `response_format` being sent as `undefined` on every non-JSON request. Now only included when actually set.
    - Fixed `json_schema` field evaluating to `false` (a boolean) instead of `undefined` when schema was missing.

    **Workers AI quirk workarounds:**
    - Added `sanitizeToolCallId()` — strips non-alphanumeric characters and pads/truncates to 9 chars, fixing tool call round-trips through the binding which rejects its own generated IDs.
    - Added `normalizeMessagesForBinding()` — converts `content: null` to `""` and sanitizes tool call IDs before every binding call. Only applied on the binding path (REST preserves original IDs).
    - Added null-finalization chunk filtering for streaming tool calls.
    - Added numeric value coercion in native-format streams (Workers AI sometimes returns numbers instead of strings for the `response` field).
    - Improved image model to handle all output types from `binding.run()`: `ReadableStream`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Response`, and `{ image: base64 }` objects.
    - Graceful degradation: if `binding.run()` returns a non-streaming response despite `stream: true`, it wraps the complete response as a simulated stream instead of throwing.

    **Premature stream termination detection:**
    - Streams that end without a `[DONE]` sentinel now report `finishReason: "error"` with `raw: "stream-truncated"` instead of silently reporting `"stop"`.
    - Stream read errors are caught and emit `finishReason: "error"` with `raw: "stream-error"`.

    **AI Search (formerly AutoRAG):**
    - Added `createAISearch` and `AISearchChatLanguageModel` as the canonical exports, reflecting the rename from AutoRAG to AI Search.
    - `createAutoRAG` still works but emits a one-time deprecation warning pointing to `createAISearch`.
    - `createAutoRAG` preserves `"autorag.chat"` as the provider name for backward compatibility.
    - AI Search now warns when tools or JSON response format are provided (unsupported by the `aiSearch` API).
    - Simplified AI Search internals — removed dead tool/response-format processing code.

    **Code quality:**
    - Removed dead code: `workersai-error.ts` (never imported), `workersai-image-config.ts` (inlined).
    - Consistent file naming: renamed `workers-ai-embedding-model.ts` to `workersai-embedding-model.ts`.
    - Replaced `StringLike` catch-all index signatures with `[key: string]: unknown` on settings types.
    - Replaced `any` types with proper interfaces (`FlatToolCall`, `OpenAIToolCall`, `PartialToolCall`).
    - Tightened `processToolCall` format detection to check `function.name` instead of just the presence of a `function` property.
    - Removed `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` and `zod` peer dependencies (no longer used in source).
    - Added `imageModel` to the `WorkersAI` interface type for consistency.

    **Tests:**
    - 149 unit tests across 10 test files (up from 82).
    - New test coverage: `sanitizeToolCallId`, `normalizeMessagesForBinding`, `prepareToolsAndToolChoice`, `processText`, `mapWorkersAIUsage`, image model output types, streaming error scenarios (malformed SSE, premature termination, empty stream), backpressure verification, graceful degradation (non-streaming fallback with text/tools/reasoning), REST API error handling (401/404/500), AI Search warnings, embedding `TooManyEmbeddingValuesForCallError`, message conversion with images and reasoning.
    - Integration tests for REST API and binding across 12 models and 7 categories (chat, streaming, multi-turn, tool calling, tool round-trip, structured output, image generation, embeddings).
    - All tests use the AI SDK's public APIs (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateImage`, `embedMany`) instead of internal `.doGenerate()`/`.doStream()` methods.

    **README:**
    - Rewritten from scratch with concise examples, model recommendations, configuration guide, and known limitations section.
    - Updated to use current AI SDK v6 APIs (`generateText` + `Output.object` instead of deprecated `generateObject`, `generateImage` instead of `experimental_generateImage`, `stopWhen: stepCountIs(2)` instead of `maxSteps`).
    - Added sections for tool calling, structured output, embeddings, image generation, and AI Search.
    - Uses `wrangler.jsonc` format for configuration examples.

## 3.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [#390](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/pull/390) [`41b92a3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/commit/41b92a34ce4d9dffba8bb42b4933bbc06e4b1aaa) Thanks [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)! - fix(workers-ai-provider): extract actual finish reason in streaming instead of hardcoded "stop"

    Previously, the streaming implementation always returned `finishReason: "stop"` regardless of the actual completion reason. This caused:
    - Tool calling scenarios to incorrectly report "stop" instead of "tool-calls"
    - Multi-turn tool conversations to fail because the AI SDK couldn't detect when tools were requested
    - Length limit scenarios to show "stop" instead of "length"
    - Error scenarios to show "stop" instead of "error"

    The fix extracts the actual `finish_reason` from streaming chunks and uses the existing `mapWorkersAIFinishReason()` function to properly map it to the AI SDK's finish reason format. This enables proper multi-turn tool calling and accurate completion status reporting.
